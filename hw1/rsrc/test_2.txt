Go Mighty Anteaters Go!
Beat Each Opposing Foe!
Oh We’ll Win The Battle Tonight!
U – C – I, Fight!
We’re Marching To Victory!
Colors Aloft, For All To See!
Oh How Faithful We’ll Always Be,
Oh True To The Blue and Gold!
U – C – I Zot
UCI Fight, Fight
To Alma Mater We Sing,
Long Let Our Praises Ring,
Oh All Hail To Irvine!
U – C – I!
BIG C
We are sons of California
Fighting for the Gold and Blue
Palms of Glory we will win for Alma Mater True
Long Beach State will soon be routed
By our dazzling C
and when we serpentine, their black will turn to green
in our hour of victory!
U (clap, clap, clap) C (clap, clap, clap), I (clap, clap, clap) Zot (clap, clap, clap)
U, C, I, ZOT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
